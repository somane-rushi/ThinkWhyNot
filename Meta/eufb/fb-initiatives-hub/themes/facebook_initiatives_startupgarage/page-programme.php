We’ve partnered with organisations including service innovation consultancy Work Play Experience, business consultancy Ctrl-Shift, the University of Southampton, to pilot a Trust, Transparency and Control Design Jam, which was dedicated to re-inventing the way we help people understand and manage how their data is used, and to give people better visibility and control over their data. The best designs come from diverse perspectives, so the Jam brought cross-industry experts from the fields of service design, user experience, behavioural science and product development together with policymakers and regulators to collaborate in person. Here are some impressions from three action-packed, high-energy days, in which participants went from brainstorms to prototypes to in-the-wild testing.

                        Looking ahead: This Jam was an experiment and we’re excited by its success. It was the first of many to come. We are committed to making a lasting impact, by taking this approach and scaling it. The ultimate goal is to create a system in which design jams for trust, transparency and control become common and frequent.</p>Posted by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookbrussels/">Facebook Brussels</a> on Tuesday, 30 May 2017</blockquote></div>
