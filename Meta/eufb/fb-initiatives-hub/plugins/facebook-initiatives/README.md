## Facebook Initiatives

**A plugin to define the content types for the Facebook Initiatives website**

### Setup

There are a combination of custom fields and post types required to setup the site.

To begin, make sure you create an About Us page and give it the menu order of `9999`. The stats heading and quote will only show if set on this page.

It does not matter what the title or slug of the page is.
