# Mercator Redirect
Redirect component for [Mercator](https://github.com/humanmade/Mercator).

Redirects to the domain listed in the `wp_blogs` table. With newer versions
of Mercator this should be treated as the primary domain.

The addon also supports redirecting to aliases for legacy data.

## Requirements
Mercator requires WordPress 3.9 or newer for the new sunrise processes. Mercator
also requires PHP 5.3+ due to the use of namespaced code.

## Installation
Include the file `redirect.php` from your `sunrise.php` in the same way you include Mercator itself.

For example:

```php
<?php
// Default mu-plugins directory if you haven't set it
defined( 'WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR' ) or define( 'WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/mu-plugins' );

require WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR . '/mercator/mercator.php';
require WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR . '/mercator-redirect/redirect.php';
```

## Filters
You can modify SSO behaviour for example in a local environment with the
following filters in `sunrise.php`:

**mercator.redirect.enabled**

Defaults to `true`

```php
// Disable redirects
add_filter( 'mercator.redirect.enabled', '__return_false' );
```

**mercator.redirect.admin.enabled**

Defaults to `false`

```php
// Enable redirecting the admin
add_filter( 'mercator.redirect.admin.enabled', '__return_true' );
```

**mercator.redirect.legacy.enabled**

Defaults to `false`

```php
// Enable legacy redirects
add_filter( 'mercator.redirect.legacy.enabled', '__return_true' );
```

**mercator.redirect.status.code**

Defaults to 301

```php
// Change http redirect from 301 to 302.
add_filter( 'mercator.redirect.status.code', function() { return 302; } );
```
